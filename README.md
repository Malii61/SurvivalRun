<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Survival Run was developed with C# on Unity. It is a single player hyper casual game.
 
The aim of the game is to kill the zombies invading the city and earn points. The player must choose the correct one from the mathematical operations that appear in front of him and strengthen his soldiers. In this way, the player learns while having fun. All codes of the game belong to me. I used the assets for testing purposes.
 
 
Here are some features of the game:
* Zombies getting stronger and trying to catch the soldiers
* Nice practice for the player with increasingly difficult math operations
